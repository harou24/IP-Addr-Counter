A Go tool to count unique IPv4 addresses from large files efficiently.

This project includes multiple implementations with varying levels of optimization for performance and memory usage:
- **naive**: A basic implementation using a map to track unique IPs as a starting point.
- **bitset**: An efficient single-threaded implementation using a fixed-size bitset (512MB for all possible IPv4 addresses) to mark seen IPs, reducing memory compared to maps.
- **concurrent**: A multi-threaded version of bitset with sharding (divides the bitset into 16384 shards) and atomic updates for thread-safe concurrency, leveraging multiple CPU cores for faster processing on large files.
- **asm**: The most optimized implementation, building on concurrent with assembly-optimized IP parsing and bit operations for lower-level efficiency. Includes compiler flags to disable bounds checks (-B), enable aggressive inlining (-l=4), disable pointer checks (-d=checkptr=0), and disable write barriers (-wb=0) for speed.

Optimizations in "asm" and variants focus on reducing runtime overheads like bounds checking and GC pauses, but they assume well-formed input.


## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.24+.
- Test data file.


### Test Data
Sample test data is provided in the repository under the `testdata` folder, including `sample_1M.txt` (100,000 IP addresses), `sample_1M_with_duplicates.txt`, and `sample_35M.txt` (35 million IP addresses). To access the full 120GB dataset, download the archive (`ip_addresses.zip`) as described in the assignment file: [IP-Addr-Counter-GO.md](https://github.com/harou24/IP-Addr-Counter/blob/unsafe/assignment/IP-Addr-Counter-GO.md). Extract the archive and place the contents in the `testdata` folder for testing.


### Makefile Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make naive FILE=<filename>` | Build and run the naive implementation on the given file. |
| `make bitset FILE=<filename>` | Build and run the bitset implementation on the given file. |
| `make concurrent FILE=<filename>` | Build and run the concurrent sharded bitset implementation on the given file. |
| `make asm FILE=<filename>` | Build and run the assembly-optimized implementation (with compiler flags for speed) on the given file. |
| `make fast FILE=<filename>` | Build and run the assembly implementation with maximum disables: GC off, no cgo checks, no async preemption, and no invalid pointer checks (via GODEBUG). Highest risk but potentially fastest for benchmarking. |
| `make profile FILE=<filename>` | Build and run with profiling enabled (generates cpu.prof, mem.prof, goroutine.prof for analysis with `go tool pprof`). |
| `make test` | Run all unit and integration tests. |
| `make bench` | Run benchmarks for all implementations and Unix command comparison. |
| `make clean` | Remove the built binary and profile files. |


## Benchmark Results

This section summarizes performance benchmarks for counting unique IP addresses using different implementations: **Asm** (assembly-optimized), **Bitset** (bitset-based), **Concurrent** (multi-threaded), and **Naive** (baseline map/set approach). Tests were run on macOS with ARM64 architecture and Apple M3 Max CPU, using input files with 1M, 10M, 35M, and 50M lines.

### Metrics
- **Time (ns/op)**: Execution time per operation (lower is better).
- **Memory (B/op)**: Bytes allocated per operation (lower is better).
- **Allocs (allocs/op)**: Heap allocations per operation (lower is better).

> **Note**: The Naive method was tested only on ~1M input for baseline comparison.

### Key Findings
- **Asm** excels in speed across all sizes, with low allocations and balanced memory usageâ€”ideal for high-performance needs.
- **Concurrent** is competitive, leveraging parallelism but slightly slower (20-50% more time) than Asm.
- **Bitset** is memory-efficient for large inputs but scales poorly in time (up to 10x slower for 50M), with high allocations.
- **Naive** is inefficient, suitable only for small datasets due to high memory and allocations.
- Time scales linearly for Asm and Concurrent; Bitset degrades for larger inputs.
- Results may vary on different hardware; profile for your use case.
